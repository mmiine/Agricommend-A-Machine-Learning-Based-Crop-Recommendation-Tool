# Project Title & Overview
Agricommend: A Machine Learning Based Crop Recommendation Tool

Our aim is to train & deploy a model that can suggest which crops to grow in a specified agricultural area by integrating data from different domains such as geography, satellite imagery, soil conditions, and weather.


# Background
There's a global food crisis happening at the very moment you're reading this.

Food insecurity, defined as "a household-level economic and social condition of limited or uncertain access to adequate food" by United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)[*](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-u-s/definitions-of-food-security/) is a significant public health concern. According to Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) 2019 report, it is affecting 26.4% of the world's population[*](https://www.fao.org/policy-support/tools-and-publications/resources-details/en/c/1269368/). 


Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC) is a humanitarian alliance, founded by the European Union (EU), FAO, and UN World Food Programme (WFP) in 2016 to tackle the root causes of food crises and support the Sustainable Development Goal to End Hunger (SDG 2). The 2022 edition[*](http://www.fightfoodcrises.net/fileadmin/user_upload/fightfoodcrises/doc/resources/GRFC_2022_FINAl_REPORT.pdf) of annual report of GNAFC shows how dire the situation is. Here are some key takeaways from the said report:


- Around 193 million people in 53 countries or territories experienced acute food insecurity at crisis or worse levels (IPC/CH Phase 3-5) in 2021. This represents an increase of ~40 million people when compared to the already record breaking numbers of 2020.

- There are 39 countries or territories are listed in all editions (since 2016) of the report. Among these regions, the number of people experiencing food crisis (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above) is almost doubled between years 2016 and 2021.

- Among those 39 regions, Democratic Republic of the Congo has the most population experiencing crisis, followed by Afghanistan and Ethiopia.

- Almost all of the ten countries mentioned above is projected to have worse conditions in terms of food accessibility in 2022.

- Over half a million people (570,000) living in Ethiopia, Madagascar, South Sudan and Yemen are experiencing the most severe phase of food insecurity Catastrophe (IPC/CH Phase 5) and requiring urgent action.

- Conflicts, environmental crises, climate crises, economic crises and rising inequality are the driving factors of the rapid increase in people experiencing acute food insecurity in 2021.

- Conflicts are seem to be the biggest contributor to the food insecurity, pushing 139 million people into acute food insecurity, up from around 99 million people in 2020.

# Key Objectives / Research Questions

- Can we increase agricultural efficiency by utilizing machine learning models?
- Can we help the farmers in low income areas by recommending them what crops to plant?


# Work Arrangement
~Ece & Meryem: Finding Datasets~

~Nazif: Writing github document~

Preparing project demo presentation

Turkey climate data integration to model

Preparing Html website 

Google Maps integration

Model deploy and integrate into website


# Approach To Work

1. Finding datasets with preferred features
2. Perform exploratory data analysis to see any trends in data
3. Figuring out which model / models to use
4. Implementing different models & assessing their performances



# Tentative Agenda

~20-31 May 2022: Fleshing out the project with all details~

June & July 2022: Implementing the algorithm and getting results

Late July 2022: Deploying the model on a webapp



# Deliverables

- An ML model trained on multi dimensional data to predict which crops to plant
- A webapp to query for results & getting crop recommendations
